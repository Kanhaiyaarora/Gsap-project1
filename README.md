🎉 Just wrapped up my first animated project using GSAP and ScrollTrigger!
This project helped me explore the world of scroll-based animations and how motion can elevate a simple layout into an engaging experience.

This is just the beginning of my animation journey — excited to explore more advanced techniques with Locomotive Scroll and Framer Motion next!
